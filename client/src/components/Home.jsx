                <p>I'm an aspiring full-stack web developer with a passion for all things technological.
                    With a couple of projects under my belt and a bunch of technologies at hand,
                    I feel ready to take on the world.</p>
                <p>
                    I love gaming and art and I love creative developing.
                    My goal is to combine these two passions into an explosive result
                    that's breathtakingly fun in the eyes.
                </p>
